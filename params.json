{"name":"SlimGraph","body":"### What is SlimGraph?\r\nSlimGraph is a simple, yet efficient graph library for the [Scala](www.scala-lang.org) programming language, designed by @rob-p and @geetduggal. The goal is to create a graph library that is easy to use, high customizable, and fast!  The library is currently being used in a number of our own projects, and so we are constantly adding new functionality (i.e. new graph types and algorithms).\r\n\r\n### But what about library X?\r\nScala is a _relatively_ new language, and thus far, there are no _de facto_ graph libraries.  In Python, for example, one might default to [NetworkX](http://networkx.lanl.gov/).  Before developing SlimGraph, we explored some of the other graph libraries available for Scala.  For a while, we settled on [Graph for Scala](https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/releases/com/assembla/scala-incubator/graph-core_2.9.1/).  That library is well designed, and though it's still under development, fairly feature rich.  However, the performance of Graph for Scala currently leaves a lot to be desired, and the speed of the current implementation led to unacceptable performance characteristics in a number of our applications.  This was the primary motivation for the creation of the SlimGraph library.  Ease of use should not be incompatible with speed, and SlimGraph aims to be easy to use and fast.\r\n","tagline":"A graph library for scala","google":"UA-31725099-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
